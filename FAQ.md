**How do I create reaction roles?**

Most people are probably best off using !rr make simply because it guides you through the process and tries to tell you what went wrong if any. Other ways of doing it includes using !rr aio which results in the same result as !rr make but with just a single command, it uses some weird syntax if you are unfamiliar, so I would recommend sticking to !rr make until you are familiar with the bot.
